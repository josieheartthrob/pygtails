About
=====

Pygtails is a simple little wrapper around the `pygame library`_.

Pygame is a cool game development library made for python, and it has a great community. It has tons of active users contributing to it's `project showcase`_. A new game is posted there sometimes several times a week, and the majority of the submissions to `pyweek`_ seem to be working with pygame. Despite all of this, it would be a lie to say that the engine has no shortcomings. In a direct quote from their `about page`_: "**It's not the best game library.** It's not even the second best. But we think it's sort of ok."

The Pygtails library attempts to make Pygame a slightly better game library by providing more detailed, organized, and (hopefully) intuitive documentation, as well as by providing some basic front-end functionality present in many popular game engines that Pygame for some reason lacks. One thing that Pygtails does not attempt to do is address the criticisms of Pygame's slowness.
